# Files-Transferring-TCP
An implementation of client-server program which Naor Alkobi and I have created, in order to transfer files between diffrent devices using a TCP server.  
First, every user sign-up to the server and gets his unique id number. With this id number the user can log-in from diffrent devices.
The client chooses a target folder which is uploaded to the server and being synced as changes accour in it. These changes are being updated in every device the user has which allow him to transfer files between diffrent devices.
