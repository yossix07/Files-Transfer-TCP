# StorgeCloud
An implementation of client-server program which Naor Alkobi and I created, in order to store files in a cloud and transfer files between diffrent devices.
First, every user sign-up to the server could and gets his unique id number. With this id number the user can log-in from diffrent devices.
The client chooses a target folder which is uploaded to the server and being synced as changes accour in it. These changes are being updated in every device the user has.
